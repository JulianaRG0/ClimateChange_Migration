# Climate Change and Global Migration Analysis Project

## Project Context and Objective

The global impact of climate change is becoming increasingly evident, primarily driven by the overproduction of greenhouse gases and the overexploitation of natural resources. One often-overlooked consequence of climate change is the migration of people due to natural disasters worldwide. This project seeks to explore the correlations between key climate change indicators, including temperature, CO2 emissions, and energy consumption, with global migration patterns.

## Repository Content
### Data Sources Document

A document detailing the sources of the datasets used in this analysis is included in the repository. It provides information on the origin, format, and any preprocessing steps applied to each dataset.

### Analysis Scripts

The repository includes Jupyter notebooks designed for data cleaning, data merging, wrangling, exploratory analysis, linear regression, and cluster analysis. These notebooks use Python and relevant libraries such as pandas, NumPy, os, matplotlib, scipy, seaborn, folium, and sklearn.

**Notebook Descriptions:**
1. **Data Cleaning and Wrangling:** This notebook focuses on preparing the datasets for analysis by addressing missing values, handling outliers, and transforming the data for consistency.

2. **Data Merging:** This notebook combines the 6 original  datasets, aligning them based on common variables, to create a comprehensive dataset for further analysis.

3. **Exploratory Analysis:** This notebook provides an in-depth exploration of the datasets, identifying trends and patterns in climate change indicators and migration data.

4. **Linear Regression:** Utilizing statistical methods, this notebook aims to establish relationships and predict migration patterns based on climate change indicators.

5. **Cluster Analysis:** Employing clustering techniques, this notebook categorizes regions based on similarities in climate change indicators and migration trends.

### Deliverables

The final report created on Tableau. The report encompasses visualizations, gathered insights, and recommendations derived from the analysis.
